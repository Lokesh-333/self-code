hand cricket...pseudo code

first the computer asks player odd or eve, eve means even. 
meaning if sum of both
their number choices is eve, and player selects eve, he wins the toss.
the sum is the choices of player and computer
the player can choose number from 1 to 4
computer also selects the number from 1 to 4

so theres something like this,

---TOSS---
player chooses eve sum is even player wins the toss, and can choose to bat or ball.
player chooses eve sum is odd computer wins the toss, and it may select to bat or ball.
player chooses odd sum is odd player wins the toss, and can choose to bat or ball.
player chooses odd sum is even computer wins the toss, and it may select to bat or ball.
----------

so in toss there are total of 2 possiblilities
player win : eve sum even (or) odd sum odd
computer win : eve sum odd (or) odd sum eve

so if player wins there are two choices he may bat or ball
if computer wins there are two choices it may select to bat or ball

meaning a total of 4 possiblilities

they are 1.player win - bat 
         2.player win - ball
         3.player loose - computer bat
         4.player loose - computer ball

senario 1.
player win - chooses to bat
so he bat first , then makes a target for computer
then computer balls then if computer reaches the target computer wins
or if computer not reach the target then player wins

wait... 

player win choosing to bat is same as computer win choosing to ball...
player win choosing to ball is same as computer win choosing to bat...
